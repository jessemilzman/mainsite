		<h1>Open Bounties</h1>
	</div>
	
	
<div class="main text">
	
  <p>If you know about something, or can teach me something, that straight up solves one of my open problems, I'm excited to compensate you for sharing it with me. </p>
    
    <p>The following are some currently outstanding bounties, related to areas that I would like to solve or substantially improve.</p>
  
    <p><b>Note 1:</b> Bounties are awarded for interventions that successfully solve my problem. It is a possibility that you'll suggest some intervention that matches what I describe, but for some reason or another, isn't actually feasible as a solution. I may pay partial bounties for partial solutions, at my own discretion. </p>
  
	<p><b>Note 2:</b> To be eligible for the full bounty, an intervention should be complete in of itself, not requiring additional research work or iteration, on my part. However, I'll gladly give partial bounties for suggestions, that I follow up on, and ultimately work. For example, if a person reaches out about a method to increase my typing speed, and we set up a session so that they can coach me through it, and it works, they've earned the full bounty. If someone contacts me and says "have you tried [x] methodology, for improving your typing? I've heard it's effective for things like that", I hadn't heard of [x] methodology, and I google around to find some way to learn [x] methodology, and this eventually leads me to a solution to my problem, I'll pay out a partial bounty (of around 10%), at my discretion.</p>
		
	<h2>Currently Posted Bounties</h2>
	
	<!--<h3>$5 - A submission of a video to this form.</h2>-->

	<h3>$2000 - A pointer to any intervention that will mitigate, slow, or delay cognitive decline from aging</h3> 

	<p>Or, alternatively, boost fluid intelligence and neuroplasticity.</p>

	<p>If you know of unusually good resources on this topic, I would pay a partial bounty for being directed to them.</p>

	<h3><b>$2000</b> - An introduction to someone that I end up dating for more than a year.</h3>
	
	<p>See my <a href="date.html">date me page</a>.</p>

    <h3><b>$1000</b> - Any intervention that <i>significantly</i> improves my personal learning rate, especially at understanding and assimilating technical / mathematical concepts. </h3>
    
	<!--<p>My current learning procedures are partially documented here. Please let me know about anything that I'm not already doing!<p> -->
	
	<p>I've collected a bunch of heurisics and processes for effective learning over the course of my life, but I continue to be excited to learn new methods. If there's something you do that helps you learn stuff, there's a pretty good chance that I'd like to learn how to do it from you.</p>

	<p>To be eligible for the full bounty, the effect should either be objectively verifiable (eg "there's a clear change in the slope of the progress-graph at the point of the intervention"), or if subjective, be strong enough that I am personally impressed that it is significant. 
	I'll give partial bounties for less impressive interventions.</p>

	<h4>Prior bounty recipients:</h4>
	<ol>
		<li>John Maxwell, for giving me the core idea of doing textbook exercies  on a spaced repetition schedule</li>
	</ol>

	
	<h3>$1000 - Any intervention that improves my sleep quality</h3>
	
	<p>More specifically, any intervention that...</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Lowers my average resting heart rate</li>
			<li>Increases my sleep efficiency (ie the time that I'm actually asleep while in bed), or</li>
			<li>Shortens sleep latency</li>
		</ol>
	
	<p>...as measured by my Oura ring, in a randomized (night by night) experiment, and is something that is feasible for me to do most nights.<p>
			

	<h3> $1000 - Safely cure my allergies.</h3>
	<p>I have both seasonal sinus allergies and food allergies, and they suck. I’ll gladly pay $1000 to anyone who can point me towards an intervention that can manage any of the following:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Permanently cure my seasonal allergies </li>
			<ul>
				<li>[note: I'm currently trying sublingual immunotherapy for this]</li>
			</ul>
		<li>Permanently cure my allergy to animal dander</li>
		<li>Permanently cure my food allergy to nuts</li>
		<li>Permanently cure my food allergy to mustard </li>
		<li>Permanently cure my food allergy to milk</li>
	
	</ul>
	
	<p> Obviously, this needs to be done in a way that is safe and healthy. I’m not interested in an almost-cure that causes me to go into anaphylactic shock down the line.</p>
	
	
	<h3> $500 - Some method for intentionally shifting my physiolological state, that I come to use relibaly</h3>


	<p>Specifically, I'm interested in methods for rapidly shifting into the following phypsiological/ psycohological states:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>"Amped up" for physical exercise (high energy, low energy-barier to intense physical exertion) </li>
		<li>Highly focused, for doing intellectual work</li>
		<li>A state of hightened social accuity for coaching and conversational faciliation</li>

	</ul>

	<p>I've experimented with a number of methods in this space including meditation, specific music, isochronic tones, auto-suggestion, and chemical stimulants. I'm interested in anything that might be faster or more reliable than my current toolset. That might include conditioned triggers, biofeedback, brain entrainment, hypnotic processes, or something even weirder. I'll pay out a bounty for anything that I end up using regularly. </p>
	
	
	<h3>$500 - Increase my typing speed by at least 10 wpm</h3>
	
	<p><a href="https://efficacyengineering.wordpress.com/category/project-learning-to-touch-type-fluidly/">Over the course of 2020</a>, I brought my average typing speed (as measured in <a href="https://play.typeracer.com/">typeracer</a>) up from about 59 words per minute to an average speed of about 75 wpm. I haven't put much effort into it since then, but I’m interested in any intervention that would systematically increase my typing speed into the range of 80 to 90 wpm, with 15 or fewer hours of practice.</p>

	
	<h3> $400 - Any intervention that would allow me to read precisely and correctly</h3>
		
	<p>I have some kind of cognitive bug such that I have substantial difficulty reading individual characters correctly. Unless I am going very slowly and carefully, paying attention with high intensity, and sometimes even then, I’m apt to read words and especially numbers incorrectly. 
	For instance, I’ll read the number “53” as “38”, or “24” as “28” and not notice that I made an error.</p>

	<p>I’m interested in any intervention that can diagnose, repair, or compensate for, this deficiency.</p>
		
	<h3>$200 - Any intervention or pedagogical method that allows me to finally learn the multiplication and division math fact families for 7, 8, and 12.</h3>
		
	<p>Possibly related to the above, learning math facts was pretty challenging for me, as a kid. As an adult, I’ve mostly gone back and repaired that gap, so that I now mostly know my multiplication and division tables.
	But the multiplication/ division math fact families involving 7, 8, and 12, just don’t seem to stick, for me. I’m interested in any method or training regime that would get them to stick for me, with a moderate amount of effort (5 hours?) on my part.</p> 

	<h3><b>$200</b> - A pointer to a safe, side-effect free steroid for increasing muscular strength.</h3>
		
	<h3> $100 - Any intervention to safely and healthily increase my bodyweight.</h3>

	<p>I weigh about 123 pounds, and would prefer to weigh around 150 pounds, so long as I can do that healthily. <p>

		
		<!---<p><b>$1000</b> - Any practical method of increasing an adults overal height by at least 2 inches, less expensive than full limb <a href="blank">lengthening surgery</a>, which is usually priced around $85,000 for a procedure in the US. External boosts like elevator shoes don't count.</p>-->
		
			<!--<p><em>$500<em> - Any intervention by which I can lower my physiological arousal, as measured by GSR, from X to Y, in under Z minutes.</p>-->
				
	<h3>$50 - A photo of me that displaces one of my top 4 photos, ranked by total score, on <a href="https://www.photofeeler.com">photofeeler.com</a>.</h3>

	<p>For context, <a href="top-four-photos.html">these</a> are my current 4 highest ranked photos. I think these shouldn't be that hard to beat.</p>
  	
	<h3>$1 per submission - links to video clips of people being asked probing questions</h3>

	<p>I’ll pay $1 (up to a total of $130 in total) for every link to a youtube video of an interview, press conference, or similar, where the interview subject is being asked about something sensitive, embarrassing, scandalous, or stressful.</p>
		
	<p>Drop your link on <b><a href="https://forms.gle/rBVgJvrNGPdCpbPB6">this google form</a></b>, with a paypal address for me to send you money. (If paypal doesn't work for you, DM me and I'll pay you some other way.)</p>
		
	<p>Some central examples of what I want:</p>

		<ul>
			<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTZahXCFq7I&t=2833s">Oprah interviewing Lance Armstrong about his doping</a></li>
			<li><a hrf="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGfaJZAdfNE&t=12s">Someone questioning Elizabeth Holmes about fraud allegations of Theranos</a></li>
			<li>A press conference in which [politician] denies and/or apologies for some sexual misconduct allegations (for example, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QI28fRb0If0">here</a>)</li>
			<li>An interview with a celebrity about their cheating / failed marriage / etc.</p></li>

		<li>A legal hearing with someone from Enron, before, during, or after it all fell apart</p></li>

		</ul>

		<p>Anything that you might describe as “X-person being grilled about Y” is great.</p>
		
		<p>Some further desiderata:</p>
		
		<ul>
			<li>Each video needs to be <i>at least 6 minutes long</i>, and largely uncut. Snippets of interviews, edited into a news segment, don’t count.</li>
			<li>If the interview covers multiple topics, only one of which is sensitive, that’s fine.</li>
			<li>Age-of-video doesn't matter. Recent examples, or ones from years and years ago, are both good.</li>
			<li>If people post duplicate videos, I'll pay the bounty to the first person to have submited, by the timestamp of submission.</li>
			<li>The video must be unscripted]</li>
		</ul>
